Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of the file, add these missing closing brackets:

    // Close viewInitializationFunctions object
};

// Close the entire module/file
}
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the `viewInitializationFunctions` object
2. Missing closing bracket for the module/file scope

The file should now be properly closed and have balanced brackets. All other content remains unchanged.
